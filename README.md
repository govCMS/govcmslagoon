## Overview

This project is used to create the images required by Lagoon, using the GovCMS distribution - it is only intended to
be used by distribution/platform maintainers.

Images are published to the [govcmslagoon](https://hub.docker.com/u/govcmslagoon) namespace on Docker Hub.

There is also the equivalent project for [GovCMS Drupal 8 images](https://github.com/govcms/govcms8lagoon). Please
be mindful that there is some duplication across the two projects, so consider whether pull requests for changes
should be accompanied by PRs on the other repository.

## Instructions

Please refer to [govcms8lagoon](https://github.com/govcms/govcms8lagoon#instructions) for guidelines.
